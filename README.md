# Takoyaki
Tako-yaki, or Tako for short is an audio recognition and data aggregation tool developed using the DiscordSpeechBot and the AI speech data provided by Nigiri-private.

## Annoucements
Tako-yaki is currently having trouble with compressed audio, and the new compression method used by Discord especially. I have ceased development after my initial release and currently have no reason to re-train and convert all the previously stored audio files. Wit.ai text-to-speech is still functional, but it's in no way perfect. The bot is still functional as a music player but has no unique features and no further official support as of 6/24

## Approved Usage
Currently Tako-yaki is only approved for usage on the official Nigiri Testing Discord as well as the Hunnic Empire Discord. Any further usage can be denied or revoked at any point.

## Usage
Available commands can be listed with the command `$help`  
You can summon Tako to current voice channel with `$join`  
You can remove Tako from your voice channel with `$leave`  

### Voice commands
Tako uses deep learning as well as wit.ai to interpret speech.  
You can use Tako as you would use any other virtual assistant, by saying his key phrase: `tako`  
Examples:  
```
tako help
tako play [input]
tako pause
```
### Remember:
There should be little sound before and after the command until it is fulfilled.
## Developer to-dos
Implement Mozilla Deepspeech  
Implement a permissions system  
Implement a moderation tool
